# COVID19plot
Download data and autogenerate plot from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ using Python

The plots that gets generated is used in my personal blog. The context and the blog can be found here: https://www.indianwesterlies.com/2020/04/would-more-covid-testing-uncover-more.html

Basically the plot tries to answer this question: Would more COVID testing uncover more COVID positive cases?
